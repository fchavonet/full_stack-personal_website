## 📄 <span id="description">Description</span>

This is the first version of my personal website, designed to showcase my professional skills and projects, and to provide a platform for potential employers or collaborators to get to know me better. While learning Bootstrap during my courses at Holberton School, I chose this technology to practice and develop my front-end skills. My objective was to quickly create a minimalistic and functional website, with a focus on a clean and responsive design that enhances user experience.

That said, I am not fully satisfied with the current outcome, and a second version will be released soon. For now, this version fulfills the exercise requirements.

## 🎓 <span id="objectives">Objectives</span>

The main objectives of this project were:

- Confirm my knowledge of the Bootstrap framework.
- Practice JavaScript for user interaction.
- Use libraries for efficiency.
- Improve front-end development skills.
- Enhance interactivity and UI/UX design.
- Create a minimalist design.
- Establish an online presence.

This project was developed as part of my coursework at Holberton School, aiming to enhance my web development skills and online presence.
